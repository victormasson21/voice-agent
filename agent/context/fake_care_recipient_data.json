Herbert still wants to do things for herself and is still mobile and enjoys going for short walks, is showing increasing signs of confusion and can be unpredictable in her willingness to accept support. She enjoys music, often singing hymns, and maintains a good appetite. While Herbert feeds herself, she may occasionally take meals in bed and appreciates a calm, supportive presence during these times.\n\nAlthough Herbert does not require personal care at this stage, she needs gentle supervision and prompting with daily routines. She is prone to night sweats and occasionally wakes during the night to make calls to local authorities, though she doesn’t require overnight assistance. She is sensitive to the cold and may choose to stay in bed longer some days. She is currently continent but may be nearing the stage of needing support in this area.\n\nMedication is managed and administered by a nurse, so no medication handling is required. However, a carer should be observant and communicate any changes or concerns as needed.\n\nChris, her husband, is a proud and independent man who prepares all meals and manages household responsibilities. He uses a stair lift and is starting to find daily life more challenging. While he does not want personal care, he would benefit from an extra pair of hands around the home and a watchful eye to ensure both his and Herbert’s wellbeing.\nNO PETS\nWIFI - yes\nBREAK GUARANTEED - yes\nNO NIGHT SUPPORT NEEDED - could be occasionally \nLICENCE REQUIRED - NO\nLOOKING FOR CARERS WHO CAN DO THE PLACEMENT ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS!!!",

Herbert still wants to do things for herself and is still mobile and enjoys going for short walks, is showing increasing signs of confusion and can be unpredictable in her willingness to accept support. She enjoys music, often singing hymns, and maintains a good appetite. While Herbert feeds herself, she may occasionally take meals in bed and appreciates a calm, supportive presence during these times.\n\nAlthough Herbert does not require personal care at this stage, she needs gentle supervision and prompting with daily routines. She is prone to night sweats and occasionally wakes during the night to make calls to local authorities, though she doesn’t require overnight assistance. She is sensitive to the cold and may choose to stay in bed longer some days. She is currently continent but may be nearing the stage of needing support in this area.\n\nMedication is managed and administered by a nurse, so no medication handling is required. However, a carer should be observant and communicate any changes or concerns as needed.\n\nChris, her husband, is a proud and independent man who prepares all meals and manages household responsibilities. He uses a stair lift and is starting to find daily life more challenging. While he does not want personal care, he would benefit from an extra pair of hands around the home and a watchful eye to ensure both his and Herbert’s wellbeing.\nNO PETS\nWIFI - yes\nBREAK GUARANTEED - yes\nNO NIGHT SUPPORT NEEDED - could be occasionally \nLICENCE REQUIRED - NO\nLOOKING FOR CARERS WHO CAN DO THE PLACEMENT ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS!!!",

Herbert still wants to do things for herself and is still mobile and enjoys going for short walks, is showing increasing signs of confusion and can be unpredictable in her willingness to accept support. She enjoys music, often singing hymns, and maintains a good appetite. While Herbert feeds herself, she may occasionally take meals in bed and appreciates a calm, supportive presence during these times.\n\nAlthough Herbert does not require personal care at this stage, she needs gentle supervision and prompting with daily routines. She is prone to night sweats and occasionally wakes during the night to make calls to local authorities, though she doesn’t require overnight assistance. She is sensitive to the cold and may choose to stay in bed longer some days. She is currently continent but may be nearing the stage of needing support in this area.\n\nMedication is managed and administered by a nurse, so no medication handling is required. However, a carer should be observant and communicate any changes or concerns as needed.\n\nChris, her husband, is a proud and independent man who prepares all meals and manages household responsibilities. He uses a stair lift and is starting to find daily life more challenging. While he does not want personal care, he would benefit from an extra pair of hands around the home and a watchful eye to ensure both his and Herbert’s wellbeing.\nNO PETS\nWIFI - yes\nBREAK GUARANTEED - yes\nNO NIGHT SUPPORT NEEDED - could be occasionally \nLICENCE REQUIRED - NO\nLOOKING FOR CARERS WHO CAN DO THE PLACEMENT ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS!!!",

Herbert still wants to do things for herself and is still mobile and enjoys going for short walks, is showing increasing signs of confusion and can be unpredictable in her willingness to accept support. She enjoys music, often singing hymns, and maintains a good appetite. While Herbert feeds herself, she may occasionally take meals in bed and appreciates a calm, supportive presence during these times.\n\nAlthough Herbert does not require personal care at this stage, she needs gentle supervision and prompting with daily routines. She is prone to night sweats and occasionally wakes during the night to make calls to local authorities, though she doesn’t require overnight assistance. She is sensitive to the cold and may choose to stay in bed longer some days. She is currently continent but may be nearing the stage of needing support in this area.\n\nMedication is managed and administered by a nurse, so no medication handling is required. However, a carer should be observant and communicate any changes or concerns as needed.\n\nChris, her husband, is a proud and independent man who prepares all meals and manages household responsibilities. He uses a stair lift and is starting to find daily life more challenging. While he does not want personal care, he would benefit from an extra pair of hands around the home and a watchful eye to ensure both his and Herbert’s wellbeing.\nNO PETS\nWIFI - yes\nBREAK GUARANTEED - yes\nNO NIGHT SUPPORT NEEDED - could be occasionally \nLICENCE REQUIRED - NO\nLOOKING FOR CARERS WHO CAN DO THE PLACEMENT ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS!!!",

Herbert still wants to do things for herself and is still mobile and enjoys going for short walks, is showing increasing signs of confusion and can be unpredictable in her willingness to accept support. She enjoys music, often singing hymns, and maintains a good appetite. While Herbert feeds herself, she may occasionally take meals in bed and appreciates a calm, supportive presence during these times.\n\nAlthough Herbert does not require personal care at this stage, she needs gentle supervision and prompting with daily routines. She is prone to night sweats and occasionally wakes during the night to make calls to local authorities, though she doesn’t require overnight assistance. She is sensitive to the cold and may choose to stay in bed longer some days. She is currently continent but may be nearing the stage of needing support in this area.\n\nMedication is managed and administered by a nurse, so no medication handling is required. However, a carer should be observant and communicate any changes or concerns as needed.\n\nChris, her husband, is a proud and independent man who prepares all meals and manages household responsibilities. He uses a stair lift and is starting to find daily life more challenging. While he does not want personal care, he would benefit from an extra pair of hands around the home and a watchful eye to ensure both his and Herbert’s wellbeing.\nNO PETS\nWIFI - yes\nBREAK GUARANTEED - yes\nNO NIGHT SUPPORT NEEDED - could be occasionally \nLICENCE REQUIRED - NO\nLOOKING FOR CARERS WHO CAN DO THE PLACEMENT ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS!!!",

They currently receive visiting care which feels insufficient. \n\nUntil recently, Grace has primarily cared for Stanley, including driving around and being quite active. However, recently he has been unwell, there is no diagnosed condition yet it's under investigation but he has had bouts of diarrhoea and constipation and felt weaker as a result. He just came out of hospital and the family need care in place urgently to bring him home safely.\n\nAs such, their children would like to find an ongoing carer to live-in with them and support with meal preparation, medication reminders, prompting to wash and just being there to provide companionship and support as needed. Stanley is noted as being prone to falling, as such, someone to keep an eye on her from that perspective would give the family peace of mind. One of their children lives closeby and visits regularly as do their other children who live further away. \n\nThis is a great placement where you'll be making a real difference to an elderly couple's quality of life at home.",

They currently receive visiting care which feels insufficient. \n\nUntil recently, Grace has primarily cared for Stanley, including driving around and being quite active. However, recently he has been unwell, there is no diagnosed condition yet it's under investigation but he has had bouts of diarrhoea and constipation and felt weaker as a result. He just came out of hospital and the family need care in place urgently to bring him home safely.\n\nAs such, their children would like to find an ongoing carer to live-in with them and support with meal preparation, medication reminders, prompting to wash and just being there to provide companionship and support as needed. Stanley is noted as being prone to falling, as such, someone to keep an eye on her from that perspective would give the family peace of mind. One of their children lives closeby and visits regularly as do their other children who live further away. \n\nThis is a great placement where you'll be making a real difference to an elderly couple's quality of life at home.",

They currently receive visiting care which feels insufficient. \n\nUntil recently, Grace has primarily cared for Stanley, including driving around and being quite active. However, recently he has been unwell, there is no diagnosed condition yet it's under investigation but he has had bouts of diarrhoea and constipation and felt weaker as a result. He just came out of hospital and the family need care in place urgently to bring him home safely.\n\nAs such, their children would like to find an ongoing carer to live-in with them and support with meal preparation, medication reminders, prompting to wash and just being there to provide companionship and support as needed. Stanley is noted as being prone to falling, as such, someone to keep an eye on her from that perspective would give the family peace of mind. One of their children lives closeby and visits regularly as do their other children who live further away. \n\nThis is a great placement where you'll be making a real difference to an elderly couple's quality of life at home.",

She will need support with her daily living, mobility, some personal care, and domestic duties. Some night support is required but there is plenty of opportunity for the carer to take longer breaks in the day time because Wendy's daughter and granddaughter live next door and will be a great source of support for the carer. The property is in a village and is within walking distance of shops. \n\nWIFI\nBREAK GUARANTEED\nFOOD ALLOWANCE ADDED ON\nPETS - One friendly, quiet and easy dog - can be kept next door with family if needed.

So o 20th January, I stood, Nil by mouth etc at 07.30 hrs with my overnight bag and a sack of my usual medications, to be told that I wasn't on the List for that day. Mrs Rasul, similarly, stood with knife in one hand and MRI scan in the other with no Thomas in front of him.  All parties were very apologetic.  The operation is now to be conducted at UHCW (University Hospital Coventry and Warwick) - Coventry,  still by Mr Rasul.  There he has better equipment to deal with the twist in my spine and the back up of an ICU.  A silver lining!   Mr Rasul said it would be \"soon\".  I do, however, now have a date: 23rd February 2026. We now need to reinstate the previous arrangements, preferably with Wanda Berger. She has offered to continue to be my number one choice."

Gardening, playing the piano (keyboard), DIY and other crafts/ maintenance jobs, now stopped because of the health issues. However, listening to my cd / disc music collection is still accessible, and enjoyed when I've got an infrequent spare minute or two! Planning the refurbishment of the spare room has been a great booster since Rita has had to go into care for remission, whilst I am unable to provide sufficient care for her myself.  I am being encouraged to sort, plan, reassess my extensive wardrobe by our weekly \"home help\". This is a challenge! And I like to help and be involved with other people!\nSince this was written, I need to add that is quite unlikely that Rita should retrun home for care as her dementia is advancing, and her personal needs are quite extesnive, with a stoma bag permanetly needed. She has mishaps when going for a wee, missing the pan sometimes, and then getting soiled.  Otherwise she is managing very well, lnows her name etc, but does have short term memory blackout, and other confusions.  It is suggested that a move back home at this stage may upset her stability.",

He loves nothing more than to go to out for lunch with his friends and family and talk of times past, and share jokes with a good mix of banter.  He is mentally very agile for his age, a little forgetful occasionally but largely very with it.  He has travelled around the world twice, and enjoys his holidays in the family apartment in Spain until his fall there last October where he unfortunately fell and broke his femur.  He was successfully operated on and is making a slow and remarkable recovery .  He has private physiotherapy three times a week and with help managing to get out of bed and take a few steps on a zimmer frame.  He wears disposable pants and needs help with changing these as he is not yet using a comode.  He is quietly determined to get back walking with his stick as soon as possible and get back to his routine of pub lunches and socialising.  He is physically very fragile though and unsteady on his feet (even before his fall in October).  We feel he will need a live in carer until his time with us is no more.  He is fun to be around and has a wicked sense or humour which can be  naughty and cheeky at times!",

This manifests itself in poor short term memory (eg she may often repeat a question) Confusion about time and space – sometimes not recognising where she is (eg do I live here?), not remembering facts about the present (eg may ask about family and friends long deceased); sometimes going to the door because she thinks the doorbell has rung. \nHas recently had a fall (January 4th 2026) and fractured a vertebrae so her mobility is temporarily reduced and as a result, she has been receiving more help with daily tasks than usual. She needs an aid to walk as she is unsteady on her feet. She gets quite tired easily and so needs regular rest and needs to be reminded to rest as she would like to keep doing things. \nHas a supportive family. (3 daughters, 5 grandchildren)\nSometimes gets up at night but can usually manage this herself.\nPrior to the fall she was  living independently. Can usually take care of her own daily needs. Uses TV, ipad and phone proficiently.\nWears hearing aids and manages them independently\n \nGenerally Anne eats food prepared from scratch. She can  prepare her own breakfast\nLunch can be a light meal e.g Ham sandwich/Boiled eggs and toast/soup and toast/Tinned fish on toast/beans on toast/omelette/\nSupper can be fish (white fish or salmon roasted, potatoes and vegetables/ready meals/)\nShe would need help to make something like cauliflower cheese \nAnne is a practising Roman Catholic. She goes to church on a Sunday morning and often on a Friday. Her religion is a central part of her life .\n",

While Maurice was at sea without Phyllis, she worked in a Building Society in South Shields. They had three daughters together, Suzanne, Louise and Oliver and moved to a lovely house in Cleadon. By now, Maurice had become a Master Mariner, but sadly, Maurice died when he was just 48 yrs old. Phyllis was only 45 at the time.\nPhyllis has never remarried and still lives in the same house in Cleadon. \nPhyllis has always had a Christian faith and for many years, worshipped at St Mark and St Cuthbert's at Cleadon Park where she served for several years as Church Warden. Phyllis had always been artistic and took up Flower Arranging. She joined a flower club and they won many awards for the amazing arrangements they put together. Phyllis also arranged the flowers at church. \nPhyllis still manages to make the most beautiful masterpices from a bunch of ordinary flowers from the supermarket or an odd flower and some foilage from her garden! These days Phyllis has a gardener to keep her garden looking wonderful.\nPhyllis loves to reminisce about her life and has a wealth of memories to relate. She loves visiting garden centers where she always enjoys a coffee or lunch. Having lived the majority of her life by the coast, she loves being driven along the sea front and stopping at car parks, esecially if they have a coffee kiosk, so she can sit enjoying a coffee whilst watching the waves. If the weather is fine, she might manage a little walk in the fresh air. ",

She prefers to sit in the back room in the morning because it's warm and sunny, then moves to the front room in the afternoon and evening.\nAn outing to a garden centre or a drive along the sea front several times each week is a welcome and beneficial change for her. She also likes lunch at local cafes now and again. ",

                    "dailyRoutine": "Phyllis wakes between 7.30 and 9.30am. She goes to the toilet then downstairs, all independantly. Straight away she needs to be prompted to take her medication from the black tablet box (already prepared on a weekly basis by her daughter). She takes her tablets with warm water. By this time she is sometimes feeling lightheaded so needs to sit on the settee while the carer makes her a cup ot tea with a tiny bit of milk and prepares some fruit for her to eat. After a while she needs to be given one Weetabix in a bowl, with a tiny sprinkling of sugar, and milk and eats it at the table. \nIf Phyllis is feeling well, she will go upstairs to wash and dress or shower and dress. Although she still showers herself, the carer needs to be around to help just in case she has any difficulties. After her shower the carer also needs to be available just in case she needs help to find items of suitable and warm enough clothing and possibly support her with dressing eg fastening her bra.\nFollowing this Phyllis needs a sit down in the back room downstairs to recover from dressing and have a glass of chilled coffee drink from the fridge.\nPhyllis likes to help decide what to eat each day. It helps her feel involved and independent if she can make suggestions and help with shopping lists. She often brings the subject up herself either before or after breakfast.\nPhyllis likes a little outing once she's dressed, most days, if she's feeling well. She is very reticent to say if she's feeling unwell and in the past, has opted to go out when she clearly isn't up to it. Sometimes she is too polite for her own good so the carer will need to use their own judgement. She has favourite garden centres with cafes, other cafes or a walk down to the village or round the block or maybe just a walk round her garden, front and back. She finds it difficult to choose so it’s best to give her a choice of two venues and she will probably still ask the carer to choose. A list of venues and addresses will be given to the carer.\nAfter a light lunch it will probably be near to the carers break. At this point, Phyllis will be in need of a rest herself. She will choose which room to sit in. She needs help turning on the tv and deciding what to watch. She also likes to be left with a hot water bottle. If it's not given to her she will go and get it herself but she is obviously in danger of scalding herself so always leave her with one.\nAfter that it will be preparing the evening meal. Sometimes she likes to help by peeling the sweet potato and setting the table but that's about the limit. Phyllis likes a dessert such fresh raspberries or strawberries with a tiny sprinkling of sugar and some cream or other prepared desserts from the fridge.\nAfter the evening meal, it's more tv in the front room. Always Emmerdale at 7.30 then she needs help to choose for the rest of the evening til 9pm when it's time for bed.\n The carer needs to prepare a fresh hot water bottle and put it in her bed just below her pillow. She also needs a small glass of warm water left on her bedside table and her handbag needs to be carried upstairs where she will \"put it in a safe place\". Phyllis usually gets ready for bed by herself but the carer needs to be available in case she needs help to undress, put on her nightie and place items of clothing into the wash. She can brush her teeth and use the toilet herself. She may need help to get into bed.  It is best that the Carer hovers to make sure she is settled in bed each evening before leaving her. \n",

Phyllis is not aware of this. It's just so we can check on Phyllis occasionally, for example sometimes when the carer is on their break. \nVery occasionally during the night, Phyllis gets confused about time and gets up and comes downstairs at 5am but then doesn’t know what to do. Before we had the camera she would sit in the cold and dark til the carer came down in the morning. Now that we've got the camera, we set the motion alarm for during the night and if Phyllis comes downstairs out of hours, we are alerted and can phone the carer to deal with the situation since it's unlikely that Phyllis would make enough noise to wake the carer. During the rest of the day, we don’t view the camera though it must always be left open. The camera is there for Phyllis's safety, not for spying on the carer. ",

She used to love sitting in the garden and listening to the birds, but it is now very difficult to get her outside as she gets scared in a wheelchair. She also used to love reading and crosswords before she lost her sight. She used to love sewing and knitting when she was able to. \n\nUPDATE: Helen's husband Alice died at home on 9th January 2026.

                    "dailyRoutine": "FOR WAKING NIGHT CARE (7pm to 7am):\n\nHelen goes to bed around 7pm as she is usually very tired by then. She has good nights and bad nights. Sometimes she will sleep for hours at a time, and only get up a few times for the toilet. Other times, she will wake frequently to go to the toilet and may not want to go back to sleep. She uses the ensuite (with help) and also has a commode next to her bed (again, with help to get on and off, and also to remind her what she is doing). \n\nShe can be unsettled at night and a little agitated, but will calm down if someone sits beside her and reassures her. She may want a drink and snack, or to sit in the lounge until she is ready to go back to bed.\n\nHelen has an alarm on her bed that goes off when she gets up, and the receiver is in the carer's room, just across the hallway.  She will need her nightie/pants and bedsheets changing if they are wet. \n\nFOR DAY CARE (7am to 7pm):\n\nHelen usually gets up between 7.30 and 8am, but may sleep in if she has had a bad night. Again, she can be very confused in the morning and may need (gently) reminding who people are and what she is doing. Her hearing aids must be put in first thing otherwise she will struggle to hear. She will go to the toilet, then be dressed (it's good to put her top on the radiator to warm it up) with a change of pull-up pants. She will usually have a fresh set of clothes every couple of days. While sitting in her bedroom she has a face wash/teeth cleaned (she will brush herself), combs her hair and then walks (with her walking frame) to the kitchen for breakfast around 8.30-9am. \n\nFor breakfast, Helen has an Actimel and up to two slices of toast and jam (breakfast is when she usually eats the most). A list of medications/timings is in the kitchen.\n\nAfter breakfast, Helen sits in the lounge, snoozing or listening to music. She gets comfort from someone sitting next to her, giving her a cuddle or holding her hand (she used to sit next to her husband on the settee). It's important to sit close to her because otherwise she will not know who is in the room with her (due to her visual impairment) and will get scared.\n\nDuring the day Helen needs to be offered hot or cold drinks (decaffeinated coffee with milk and one sugar, hot chocolate, squash) and encouraged to drink them. If she wants to walk anywhere with her frame she needs to be accompanied, to remind her where she is going, what she is doing, help her on and off the toilet and clean her up if necessary. \n\nHelen has a simple lunch (which she calls dinner) around 12.30pm, often something on toast (such as tomatoes, banana or beetroot), a jacket potato (skin removed) with baked beans, or a small portion of fish fingers and chips. Tea is around 5pm, again something simple such as a scone/crumpet/hot cross bun and a cold drink. Always offer a pudding after every meal and biscuits during the day.\n\nAfter tea, Helen will get ready for bed (toilet/put on nightie and dressing gown/clean pair of pull-up pants). In the evening she can get a little stroppy, and needs someone who is very kind and patient. She cannot see and is often confused, so needs help with everything. She will then go into the lounge for a hot or cold drink until bedtime.\n \nHelen doesn't like being washed (she is always cold) and can get distressed. It is a case of washing what is possible (with particular attention to her bottom as she wears pull-ups all day and night, and can get sore), either in the morning before she gets dressed or in the evening before getting ready for bed, depending on her mood. \n\nHelen hates having her hair washed, and it's a struggle to do that each week.",

She likes fish and vegetables, soup, salad, she does have 1 or 2 ready meals (fish pie) a week but does not live on ready meals (useful if it has been a a busy day. (I have noticed she is increasingly having softer foods to eat (mashed potaoe) she loves fish and chips, potato wedges. I also think she is going for a preference for stronger flavours or salty or sweet. \nMum also has a range of desserts - she especially likes fresh fruit, trifles, mousses, yogurts, cream cakes, crisps\n 8-10pm - mum knows when she wants to go to bed and it is between this time.
