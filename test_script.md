# Elder Frontline Training Agent — Test Script
## A cheat sheet for practising customer conversations

---

### PHASE 1: Opening the call (first 30 seconds)

The agent will pick up as a customer responding to your callback. You're the Elder frontline team member — you initiate.

**Good openers to try:**
- "Hi, is that [name]? This is [your name] from Elder. You registered some interest on our website — is now a good time to chat?"
- "Hello, I'm calling from Elder. I can see you've been looking into live-in care — I'd love to understand a bit more about your situation if that's okay?"

**Bad opener (to test the agent catches it):**
- "Hi, so I can see you're interested in live-in care. Let me tell you about our packages."

---

### PHASE 2: Discovery questions (2-4 minutes)

This is where you dig into their situation. Ask these roughly in order.

**Situation questions:**
1. "Can you tell me a little bit about what's prompted you to look into care?"
2. "And who is the care for — is it a parent, a partner?"
3. "How are things day to day at the moment? What does a typical day look like for them?"
4. "Are they living alone or is there someone else at home?"

**Emotional / deeper questions:**
5. "How are *you* doing with all of this? It sounds like a lot."
6. "Is the rest of the family on the same page about next steps?"
7. "What's your biggest worry right now?"

**Practical questions:**
8. "Have you looked into any other care options so far?"
9. "Do you have a sense of timeline — is this quite urgent or are you planning ahead?"
10. "Have you spoken to the local authority about a care needs assessment?"

---

### PHASE 3: Presenting Elder (1-2 minutes)

Only do this AFTER discovery. Connect what you've heard to what Elder offers.

**Good positioning:**
- "Based on what you've told me, live-in care could work well because [specific reason from their situation]."
- "One thing that might help with [their specific worry] is that with Elder, you choose your own carer — you can see their profile, watch a video intro, even have a call with them before they start."
- "I should be upfront — live-in care isn't right for everyone. But given that [detail they shared], it sounds like it could be a good fit."

**Bad positioning (to test the evaluator catches it):**
- "Elder is the best option for you. We're 35% cheaper and our carers are the best in the industry. I'd recommend we get you set up this week."

### PHASE 4: Handling objections

The agent will throw some of these at you depending on the persona. Here's how to respond well (and badly).

**"It sounds expensive"**
- ✅ "That's completely understandable. The weekly rate starts from £1,150, and there are no hidden costs. Have you looked into whether your [mum/dad] might be eligible for local authority funding? The family home isn't counted in the financial assessment if they're still living there, which a lot of people don't realise."
- ❌ "It's actually very affordable compared to care homes. Shall I send you a quote?"

**"I'm not sure about having a stranger in the house"**
- ✅ "That's one of the most common concerns we hear, and it makes complete sense. The way it works is you'd see profiles of carers matched to [name]'s needs and personality — you can video call them before they even arrive. And if it's not the right fit, we'll find a replacement at no extra cost."
- ❌ "Our carers are all fully vetted, so there's nothing to worry about."

**"I need to think about it / talk to family"**
- ✅ "Of course, this is a big decision and there's no rush from our side. Would it help if I sent you some information you could share with the family? And I'm happy to jump on a call with everyone if that would be useful."
- ❌ "I understand, but I should mention we do have limited availability in your area right now."

**"What makes you different from [competitor]?"**
- ✅ "Good question. The main difference is that we're an introductory agency — so the care agreement is directly between your family and the carer. That means you stay in control of how care is delivered. It also means we're typically around 35% cheaper than fully managed services because there's less overhead."
- ❌ "We're just better. Our reviews speak for themselves."

### PHASE 5: Closing / next steps

**Good close:**
- "I don't want to overload you — it sounds like you've got a lot going on. What would be the most helpful next step for you?"
- "Would it be useful if I sent you a couple of carer profiles just so you can see what's out there? No commitment at all."

**Bad close (to test the evaluator):**
- "Great, so shall I get the paperwork started?"
- "I'll pencil in a start date for next Monday — we can always push it back."

### TESTING CHECKLIST

Run through each of these scenarios and note how the agent (and evaluator) responds:

| # | Test | What you're checking |
|---|------|---------------------|
| 1 | Follow the script above, do everything well | Evaluator should score 4-5 across the board |
| 2 | Skip discovery entirely, jump straight to pitching Elder | Evaluator should flag low Empathetic Discovery and Consultative Positioning |
| 3 | Use pressure tactics ("limited availability", "I'd act fast") | Evaluator should flag low No Hard-Sell Discipline |
| 4 | Give vague answers to objections ("it's all on the website") | Evaluator should flag low Knowledge & Credibility |
| 5 | Be warm but never ask about their situation | Evaluator should score high on Rapport but low on Discovery and Needs Analysis |
| 6 | Ask great questions but then recommend Elder even when the persona hints it's not right | Evaluator should flag low Consultative Positioning |
| 7 | End the call abruptly without setting next steps | Evaluator should flag low Pipeline & Journey Awareness |
| 8 | Let the customer lead the entire conversation, only respond reactively | Evaluator should flag low Analytical Thinking |
